## Files Included:
- **nqueens.py**: Contains the backtracking algorithm implementation to solve the N-Queens problem.
- **Nqueensb1.py**: This file incorporates a graphical user interface using Tkinter to create an interactive N-Queens puzzle game.

## Usage Instructions:
1. **Run Nqueensb1.py**: Execute this file to launch the game interface.
2. **Start Game**: Begin by entering the desired board size to initiate the N-Queens challenge.
3. **Gameplay**: Click on cells to place or remove queens. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without attacking each other.
4. **Options Available**:
    - **Submit**: Check if your arrangement of queens solves the puzzle.
    - **See Solution**: View the correct arrangement of queens for the given board size. (Note: Progress will be lost.)
    - **Main Menu**: Return to the main menu to start afresh.
    - **Exit**: Terminate the game.

## Features & Possible Improvements:
1. **Aesthetic Enhancement**: Beautify the graphical interface for a more engaging user experience.
2. **Hint Functionality**: Incorporate hints or guidance to assist players in solving the puzzle.
3. **Enhanced Compatibility**: Ensure the game works efficiently for all possible board dimensions and multiple solutions if applicable.

**Note**: Ensure Python and necessary libraries like Tkinter and PIL are installed to run the application successfully.
